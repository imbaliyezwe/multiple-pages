        A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
        shape of
        the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants
        are named
        for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
        succession,
        then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky
        texture,
        similar to a puff pastry.

        The modern croissant seems to have been created by the French chef Sylvain Claudius Goy.[2]

        Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since
        antiquity.[3]
        Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was
        developed in
        the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened
        laminated
        dough.[4] In the late 1970s, the development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into
        a fast
        food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain,
        was a
        French response to American-style fast food,[5] and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in French bakeries
        and
        patisseries were baked from frozen dough.[6]

        Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
